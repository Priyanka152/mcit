Linux practices:


# Working with files:

1. In order to create a directory use `mkdir` command

    `mkdir ~/temp`

    It creates a directory called **temp** in your home folder (**~** is short for home folder in Linux)

1. In order to create a file use `touch` command

    `touch ~/temp/new_file`

    It will create an empty file called **new_file** under **~/temp/** folder

1. In order to edit a file use `nano` command

    `nano ~/temp/new_file`

    It will open the **~/temp/new_file** for you to edit. Type "Hello world!" in the first line.
    In order to save and exit use `CTRL+X` key combination.
